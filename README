Hello

This is an OpenID provider that does very little
Ideal for testing
Just start it up

rackup rack_my_id.rb --port 9294

And now your openid is http://localhost:9294
You don't even need a password

Start it up at the beginning of your automated test run
Shut it down at the end
(check webrat/selenium/sinatra_application_server.rb for a hint)

This is just Rack middleware, so you could add it to your own project

Sorry there isn't a test suite. It works with CloudKit::OpenIDFilter, which is what I needed. PDI.

Love Xav
